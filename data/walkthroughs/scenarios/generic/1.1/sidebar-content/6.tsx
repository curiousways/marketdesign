      A buyer has some maximum amount that they are prepared to pay for their
      desired bundle of credits. We describe this as the buyer’s value. In this
      case, the buyer’s value is £210,000.
    </p>

      To participate in the market, the buyer must enter a bid. Their offer
      states the maximum amount that they would be prepared to pay for their
      required credit bundle. Obviously that bid should never be above their
      value but, again, bidding at value is not a bad option. Such a bid
      maximises a buyer’s chances of winning and since the market rewards
      winning buyers with a discount, they are also certain that the payment
      they must make for their desired credit bundle is less than their value.

      In the example, the developer has followed that advice and entered an
      offer of £210,000.
