      To participate in the market, the landholder must enter an offer. Their
      offer states the minimum amount that they would accept to undertake their
      project. Obviously that offer should never be below the project cost.

      it maximises a landholder’s chances of winning. Moreover, since the market
      rewards winning landholders with a bonus, they are also guaranteed to
      receive a payment larger than their costs.

      offer of £60,000.
