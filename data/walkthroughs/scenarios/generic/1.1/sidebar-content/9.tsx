      The first step in the Lindsay Mechanism is to identify all the market
      solutions that are ‘feasible’. A market solution is feasible if the

    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-5">
      <li>
        The number of credits of each type supplied by winning sellers is at
        least as large as the number demanded by winning buyers.
      </li>
      <li>
        The total money bid by winning buyers is as least as much as the total
        money asked for by winning sellers.
      </li>
    </ul>
