      In the market solution shown here, buyer 2 and seller 2 are selected as
      winners. We can see this is feasible because the credits quantities
      provided by seller 2 are greater than the quantities demanded by buyer 2.
      Moreover, buyer 2’s bid is greater than the payment request from seller 2.
      The difference between how much buyers are prepared to pay and what
      sellers requested as payments is known as the Market Surplus. In this
      case, that is £20,000.
