      states the maximum amount that they would be prepared to pay for their
      required credit bundle. Obviously that bid should never be above their
      value but, again, bidding at value is not a bad option. Such a bid
      maximises a buyer's chances of winning and since the market rewards
      winning buyers with a discount, they are also certain that the payment
      they must make for their desired credit bundle is less than their value.
