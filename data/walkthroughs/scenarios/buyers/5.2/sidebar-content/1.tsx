      In the previous walkthrough we imagined an investor that had separated
      their investment budget up into different pots, one for each type of
      credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way in which an investor might choose to bid in the market, is to
      set just one budget for investment across all credit types. The market
      would then select the quantities of each type of credit that the investor
      should acquire within that budget in order to get the most surplus in
      purchasing credits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roughly speaking, the mechanism makes that choice by observing the
      investorâ€™s valuation of each credit type and selecting credits of
      whichever type are cheapest compared to that valuation.
