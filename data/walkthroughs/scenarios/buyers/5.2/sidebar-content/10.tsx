      The market solves and your bid was successful. The market managed to
      provide you with 2 of the 4 biodiversity credits you wanted and 4 of the
      10 water quality credits you wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the market outcome, we have scaled down your bids to show the maximum
      you were prepared to pay for those reduced quantities of credits. Those
      amount to £50,000 and £40,000 or a total payment of £90,000, so within the
      budget limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, you get your share of the surplus and receive a discount of
      £16,000 meaning you only pay £74,000 for the bundle of credits that you
      secured in the market.
