      Unfortunately, your bid was not successful. Indeed, the only deal that is
      done matches Seller 2 with Buyer 2.

      If Seller 3 were also to supply credits, then that would ensure sufficient
      credits in the market to meet Buyer 1's demand. Unfortunately, Buyer 1 is
      not willing to pay quite enough to cover Seller 3's costs.

      Sadly, your bid does nothing to improve the market outcome. While you
      would be willing to contribute towards Seller 3's costs, Seller 3 cannot
      meet your demand for biodiversity credits on top of those required by
      Buyer 1. A trade is just not possible.
