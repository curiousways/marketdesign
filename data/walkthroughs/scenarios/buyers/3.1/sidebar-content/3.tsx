    <p>
      The market consists of 3 sellers and 2 other buyers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to the other buyers your demand looks reasonably uncompetitive.
      You are only willing to pay up to £20,000 for each credit in your bundle
      while the two other buyers have entered bids of nearer £30,000 per credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's suppose you make the pragmatic decision of bidding at value. Submit
      a bid at £60,000 and then solve the market.
