      It is not always the case that a buyer needs to secure every credit in
      their desired credit bundle. They may, for example, be prepared to buy
      some credits in this market round and then seek to purchase the remainder
      in a later market round or from some other credit supplier.

      This walkthrough demonstrates how a buyer can signal this to the market by
      entering a divisible bid. By making their bid 'divisible' a buyer
      indicates that they are happy to buy 100% of their desired credits for
      100% of their bid but, if that's not possible, will accept some smaller
      percentage. The market might, for example, end up providing them with 50%
      of their desired credits associating that allocation with a maximum
      payment of 50% of their original bid.
