    <p>
      The market solves and your bid was partially successful. The best the
      market could do for you while optimising market surplus, was to satisfy
      two thirds (67%) of your bid. The shading on your bid has changed to
      reflect this outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      As such, you secure two thirds of the credit bundle you bid for, namely 2
      biodiversity credits and 4 water quality credits, and that is provided to
      you for a payment that is no more than two thirds of your bid, namely
      £120,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual you receive your fair share of the bonus, in this case £19,000
      and, as a result, secure your credits for a payment of £101,600.
