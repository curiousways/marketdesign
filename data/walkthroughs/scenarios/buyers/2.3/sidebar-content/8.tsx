      Not surprisingly, you are successful. The market again generates a surplus
      of £140,000, but this time you are rewarded with the lion's share of that
      surplus as a discount of £130,000.

      Your share of the surplus is high because, unlike in the previous market,
      your demand was critical to the creation of market surplus.

      The key lesson here is that how well a buyer fare's in the market not only
      depends on how they bid but also on the level of competition that they
      face in sourcing credits.
