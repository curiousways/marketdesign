      The key lesson of this walkthrough is that offering to pay a lot per
      credit is not the only reason a buyer's bid will be successful. A bid can
      also meet with success if it happens to provide a good fit to the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often a 'good fit' bid will be one that somehow 'plugs a gap' between
      demand and supply allowing trades to go ahead. For that reason, 'good fit'
      bids are often relatively small in size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since information on the bids and offers entered into the market is not
      available to you, it would never be possible to deliberately construct a
      'good fit' bid. But, where possible, it may be advantageous to consider
      separating a larger bid into smaller component bids. That will not
      disadvantage you but may also be beneficial in the event that one of your
      smaller bids happens to provide a good fit to the market.
