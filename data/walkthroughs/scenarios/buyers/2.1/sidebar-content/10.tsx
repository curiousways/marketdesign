      Indeed, all market participants are able to complete the deals they wanted
      in this market. With lots of trades possible, the market generates a large
      surplus of £360,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since all buyers and sellers contribute in roughly equal measure to the
      generation of that surplus, they each receive a similar share of the
      surplus as a bonus or discount. You, for example, receive a discount of
      £72,000. And, as a result, pay only £208,000 for your credits.
