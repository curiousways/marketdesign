      We will see that a buyer will pay relatively more when there is lots of
      competition to get hold of the credits that they want and relatively less

      Let's imagine you are a buyer seeking to purchase a bundle of credits
      consisting of 3 biodiversity credits and 3 water quality credits. The
      value of securing that bundle to you is Â£280,000.

      Our first market setting is one in which the market is relatively balanced
      containing 3 sellers and 2 other buyers. With you, that makes 3 buyers in
      total.
