      Finally, let’s consider what bidding will be like in a real market where
      you are not provided with information on the bids and offers of other
      market participants.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new set of market participants are shown to the right, but without
      revealing details on their bids and offers. How should you bid in this
      situation?
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ve given you a choice between a bid at value at £120,000, or a bid
      below value of £100,000 or £80,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you’ve made your decision submit your bid and solve the market.
