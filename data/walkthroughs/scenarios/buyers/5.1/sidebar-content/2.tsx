      To illustrate, let’s imagine you are a buyer seeking to purchase some
      biodiversity credits and some water quality credits.
    </p>
    <p>
      As shown above, your budget for biodiversity credits is £80,000 and you
      are willing to pay up to £20,000 for each credit of that type. Likewise
      you have set aside a budget of £30,000 to invest in water quality credits
      and are willing to pay up to £15,000 per credit.
