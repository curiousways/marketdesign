    <p>
      The market solves and your bid was partially successful. The market
      managed to provide you with 3 of the 4 biodiversity credits you wanted and
      1 of the 2 water quality credits you wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand better this market outcome, we have scaled down your bids to
      show the maximum you were prepared to pay for those reduced quantities of
      credits. Those amount to £60,000 and £15,000 or a total payment of
      £75,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, you get your share of the surplus and receive a discount of
      £22,000 meaning you only pay £53,000 for the bundle of credits that you
      secured in the market.
