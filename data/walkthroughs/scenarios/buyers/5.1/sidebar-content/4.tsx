    <p>
      Your investment project bid now appears in the market. Notice we have taken
      your bid for each type of credit and worked out the number of credits you
      could buy at that price within your budget. This is the demand for credits
      that your bid implies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also notice we have made your bid divisible. As an investor, we assume
      that if the market cannot provide you with your demand quantities you
      would still be keen to acquire fewer credits so long as each costs you
      less than your credit valuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go ahead and solve the market.
