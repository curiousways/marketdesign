      Since you entered a lower bid, you generate less surplus for the market
      than when you bid at value.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a consequence, the share of the market surplus you receive as a
      discount is also smaller; falling from £10,250 to £2500.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the same, bidding lower worked to your overall advantage. Even with
      the smaller discount, you managed to source your credit bundle for only
      £97,500.
