      Let's imagine that you are a developer planning a building project on the
      parcel of land shown on the map. To progress that project the planning
      authority requires you to source 1 biodiversity credit and 3 water quality
      credits to offset the environmental damages your development will
      generate.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have a good idea of the profits that you will make from the building
      project and calculate that you can pay up to £120,000 to acquire this
      credit bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      These private details of your building project are shown in the ‘My
      Projects’ box at the top of this panel.
