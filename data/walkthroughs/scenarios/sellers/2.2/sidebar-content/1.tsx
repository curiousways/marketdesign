      Now consider how things would play out if market conditions were
      different. Rather than a relatively good balance of buyers and sellers,
      this market is restricted on the demand side; only one buyer has entered a
      bid for credits. Again, submit an offer at cost for a minimum payment of
      Â£140,000 and then solve the market.

      supply that buyer with credits.
