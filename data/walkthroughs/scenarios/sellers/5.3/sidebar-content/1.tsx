      Fortunately, the market allows you to enter both project options as an
      'Either/Or' offer. The market will then choose the option that delivers
      you the most surplus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try that now. Enter an offer at cost for the woodland project at £140,000
      and an offer at cost for the wetland project at £180,000. Since those are
      both projects on the same field, the market knows this is an Either/Or
      offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Submit your Either/Or offer and then solve the market.
