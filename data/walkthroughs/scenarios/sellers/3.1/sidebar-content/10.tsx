    <p>Unfortunately, your bid was not successful.</p>

      Indeed, the only deal that is done matches Seller 1 with Buyers 2 and 3
      and the market makes a surplus of £280,000.
    </p>

    <p>
      Buyer 1 is willing to pay quite a bit to get hold of credits. Seller 2 can
      provide many of the credits desired that Buyer wants but not quite enough
      to make a trade possible.

      Unfortunately, your project doesn’t do anything to unlock that demand. You
      simply don’t offer quite enough water quality credits to ‘plug the gap’
      between supply and demand.
