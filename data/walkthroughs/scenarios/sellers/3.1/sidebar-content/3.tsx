    <p>The market consists of 3 buyers and 2 other sellers.</p>
    <p>
      Compared to the other sellers your costs look uncompetitive. You need a
      payment of over £30,000 for each credit supplied by your project while the two
      other sellers have entered offers asking for nearer £10,000 per credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's suppose you make the pragmatic decision of bidding at cost. Submit a bid
      at £100,000 and then solve the market.
