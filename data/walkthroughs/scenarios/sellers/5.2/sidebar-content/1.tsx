      Now imagine that you know that you can make cost savings if you carry out
      both projects together.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Field 1 project on its own would cost you £140,000 and the Field
      2 project £70,000, if you execute both projects your costs are only
      £170,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doing both projects together is equivalent to a single big project
      offering 5 biodiversity credits and 3 water quality credits. This is now
      shown as a third option in the My Projects box above.
