      Our first market setting is one in which the market is relatively balanced
      containing 3 buyers and 2 other sellers. With you, that makes 3 sellers in
      total.
    </p>
    <p>The bids and offers made by the other market participants are shown here.</p>
    <p>
      Let’s suppose you make the pragmatic decision of offering at cost. Submit a
      bid at £140,000 and then solve the market.
