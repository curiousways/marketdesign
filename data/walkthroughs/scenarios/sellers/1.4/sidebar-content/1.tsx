      Finally, let’s consider trying to sell your project in a real market where
      you are not provided with information on the bids and offers of other
      market participants.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new set of market participants are shown to the right, but without
      revealing details on their bids and offers. How should you offer in this
      situation?
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ve given you a choice between an offer at cost of £60,000, or an offer
      above cost asking for at least £80,000 or at least £100,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you’ve made your decision submit your offer and solve the market.
