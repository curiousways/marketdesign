      The key lesson of this walkthrough is that asking for a low payment per
      credit is not the only reason a landholder’s offer will be successful. An
      offer can also meet with success if it happens to provide a good fit to
      the market. Often a ‘good fit’ offer will be one that somehow ‘plugs a
      gap’ between demand and supply allowing trades to go ahead. For that
      reason, ‘good fit’ offers are often relatively small in size.

      Since information on the bids and offers entered into the market is not
      available to you, it would never be possible to deliberately construct a
      ‘good fit’ offer. But, where possible, it may be advantageous to consider
      separating a larger project into smaller component projects. That will not
      disadvantage you but may also be beneficial in the event that one of the
      offers coming from these smaller projects happens to provide a good fit to
      the market.
