      As would be expected the market chose to fund your wetland project. What
      is a little more surprising is that you have now been rewarded with an
      even larger share of the surplus. As part of an Either/Or offer your
      wetland project receives a bonus of £73,000 which is more than the £50,000
      bonus it received when entered as a standalone project offer.

      By providing two project options, your Either/Or offer opens up more
      possibilities for the market to find surplus-generating trades. In that
      way, your Either/Or bid contributes more to surplus generation and thus is
      rewarded with a larger bonus.
