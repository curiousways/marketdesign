      The market into which you plan to enter an offer consists of 1 other
      seller and 3 buyers who have entered the bids and offers shown here.

    <p>You have 3 options open to you;</p>
    <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-5">
      <li>Offer up the woodland project</li>
      <li>Offer up the wetland project</li>
      <li>
        Offer both projects and let the market choose which (if either) should
        be funded
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As we shall see, letting the market choose will always be your best
      choice.
