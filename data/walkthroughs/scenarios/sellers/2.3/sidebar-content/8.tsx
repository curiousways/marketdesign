    <p>Not surprisingly, you are successful.</p>
    <p>
      The market again generates a surplus of £140,000, but this time you are
      rewarded with the lion's share of that surplus as a bonus of £130,000. You
      get paid £270,000 for your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your share of the surplus is high because, unlike in the previous market,
      your credit supply was critical to the creation of market surplus.
