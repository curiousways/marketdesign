    <p>
      Let’s imagine that you are such a landholder and the planned location of your
      project is on the parcel of land shown on the map. That project has been
      assessed and once established will deliver 2 biodiversity credit and 3 water
      quality credits.

    <p>
      You have a good idea of the cost of this project in terms of up-front outlay,
      maintenance costs and on-going foregone income from farming.
    </p>

    <p>
      You estimate that the minimum you need to be paid now to compensate for those
      costs is £60,000.
