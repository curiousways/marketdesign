      What offer should you make for your project in this market? Given your
      costs are £60,000 it would make little sense to enter an offer asking less
      than that.
    </p>

    <p>
      For two reasons, a more sensible strategy might be to make an offer at
      your costs:
    </p>
    <p>
      1 - Maximise your chance of success: Since this is the least you would
      possibly accept to do the project, offering at cost affords you the very
      best chance of having your project funded.
    </p>
    <p>
      2 - Get paid more than your cost: In the Lindsay Mechanism, successful
      sellers receive a share of the market surplus as a bonus. So, if even if
      you offer at cost, you will almost certainly end up getting paid more.
    </p>

    <p>Following that logic, enter an offer of £60,000 and press submit.</p>
