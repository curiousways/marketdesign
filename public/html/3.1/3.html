<p>The market consists of 3 sellers and 2 other buyers.</p>
<p>
  Compared to the other buyers your costs look uncompetitive. You are need a
  payment of over £30,000 for each credit supplied by your project while the two
  other sellers have entered offers asking for nearer £10,000 per credit.
</p>
<p>
  Let’s suppose you make the pragmatic decision of bidding at cost. Submit a bid
  at £100,000 and then solve the market.
