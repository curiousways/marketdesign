<p className="font-bold">Key Takeaway</p>

<p>Offering credits at cost will tend deliver two outcomes:</p>

<div>
  <p>1/ Increase your chance of winning</p>
  <p>2/ Deliver you a greater share of the bonus.</p>
</div>

<p>
  (Note â€“ a greater share of the bonus does not necessarily mean a bigger
  payment, as the next scenario will illustrate)
