<p class="font-bold">Market outcome with your “significantly above-cost” bid</p>

<p>If your offer is too high, you risk being unsuccessful.</p>
<p>
  In this scenario, you increase your offer by another £20,000 to £100,000 and
  the market identifies a more efficient configuration of trades.
</p>
<p>
  Note that your elimination changes the entire outcome of the market, including
  which buyers and sellers are successful and how big the surplus (and therefore
  the bonus) is.
