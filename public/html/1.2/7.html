<p className="font-bold">Distributing the surplus</p>

<p>
  Not only is the total surplus smaller, but because your offer is higher than
  before, your contribution to the surplus is also smaller.
</p>

<p>Which means that your bonus will be smaller (£17,000 vs £25,000).</p>

<p>
  However, as you can see, you make more money overall, as does the other
  successful seller, who receives a bigger bonus than before, despite their
  offer being unchanged.
