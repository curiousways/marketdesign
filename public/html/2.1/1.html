  In this walkthrough we explore how competition in the market impacts on market
  outcomes for a project seller.

  We will see that a seller will be paid relatively more for their project when
  there is lots of competition between buyers trying to get hold of the credits
  that their project supplies and relatively less when there are lots of other
  sellers with projects that can also meet the demand for credits.
