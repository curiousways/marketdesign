<p>
  Now consider how things would play out if your project were just slightly
  different.
</p>

<p>
  While the bids and offers for the other market participants remain the same,
  rather than 2 biodiversity credit and 1 water quality credits your required
  project now supplies for 1 biodiversity credits and 2 water quality credit,
  again at a cost value to you of £100,000.
</p>

<p>Again, submit a bid at cost for £100,000 and then solve the market.</p>
